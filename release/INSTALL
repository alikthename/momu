As this current release of MoMu targets the iPhone platform, and the spirit
of this toolkit to enable developers to rapidly develop sweet interactive
audio applications, we'll leave the installation up to you.  In some cases,
you might simply want include a particular module (e.g., MoAccel), in which
you only need to bring in or reference the associated files (e.g., mo_accel.h,
mo_accel.mm, as well as the shared mo_def.h).

We hope you find this useful!  Have fun with it!

All the best,
Nick, Jorge, Jieun, and Ge
